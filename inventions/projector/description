# 📚 **Slide Projector – Interactive AR Story Viewer**

### *An old slide projector resurrected to project living, animated stories.*

---

## 🧩 **What the New Invention Is**

The **Interactive AR Story Viewer** transforms a traditional slide projector into a modern storytelling device.
Instead of projecting static images onto a wall, it projects **animated, AR-enhanced story slides** that move, react, and change as the user interacts.

The projector becomes:

* a storytelling machine
* a creative tool
* an educational device
* a magical experience

The idea:

> “A projector that once showed memories now brings stories to life.”

# ⚙️ **How It Works**

### 🖼️ **1. Digital Slides Instead of Film**

The projector no longer uses physical film slides.
Each “slide” is a:

* digital image
* animated scene
* small AR hologram
* interactive learning card

Slides can contain:

* characters that move
* labels that highlight
* 3D elements
* animated diagrams

---

### 🤳 **2. Wall-Becomes-Screen AR Effect**

When the projector shines onto a wall:

* objects appear to *lift off the wall*
* characters move slightly
* elements animate in place
* depth/motion parallax is applied

This creates a subtle AR illusion **without needing goggles**.

---

### 🎛️ **3. Slide Wheel Controls the Story**

Just like the old rotary slide wheel:

* user turns the wheel forward → next slide
* turns backward → previous slide

But now, each turn triggers:

* animated transitions
* sound effects
* interactive elements

---

### 📖 **4. Interactive Storytelling Mode**

Each slide can contain:

* text narration
* voice narration
* animated moments
* branching choices

For example:

> Slide 5: “Should the character enter the forest or stay by the lake?”
> User picks → the next slide changes based on their choice.

---

### 🧠 **5. AI-Assisted Content**

The system can:

* generate new slides
* create educational diagrams
* produce illustrated stories
* rewrite narration in different styles

All within the retro projector interface.

AI can also:

* answer questions about the current slide
* explain difficult concepts
* add hints

---

### 📦 **6. Slide Collections**

Users can switch sets:

* bedtime stories
* history lessons
* science diagrams
* spooky tales
* travel slideshows
* art collections

Each set has its own:

* visual theme
* soundscape
* transition animations

---

# 🖥️ **UI Description (for Kiro)**

### 🖥️ **1. Projector Display Setup**

---

### 🎞️ **3. Slide Types**

---

### 🔊 **4. Sound Design**

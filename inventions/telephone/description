Here is a **clear, visual, Kiro-ready description** of the **UI** for the Telephone invention —
specifically how the website should **show the coffee machine turning on, lights changing, music playing, etc.** when the user dials the phone.

This describes **exactly what should appear on the screen**, how it should animate, and how the user should experience the “smart home” reacting.

# ☎️ **UI Description — Smart Home Telephone Interaction**

### *How the website should visually show the home responding to each dial command*

When the user enters the telephone’s “Resurrection Lab” page or haunted room, they see the **vintage rotary telephone** sitting on a small table inside a cozy, dimly lit house interior.

Behind the phone is a **stylized room UI** that shows different parts of a smart home:

* Lights
* Coffee machine
* Music player / speaker
* Weather panel
* Door lock indicator
* AC / thermostat

Each reacts visually whenever the user “dials” the phone.

# 🛋️ **1. Main UI Layout**

The screen is divided into two key areas:

### **LEFT SIDE → Telephone**

* A beautifully rendered rotary phone
* The dial rotates when the user clicks numbers
* The phone lights up during “processing”
* The receiver lifts slightly during “voice” actions

### **RIGHT SIDE → Smart Home Reaction Panel**

This is a cozy illustrated home interior with interactive components:

* A lamp or ceiling lights
* A coffee machine on a counter
* A speaker with sound waves
* A small window showing the weather
* A thermostat dial
* A door icon with lock/unlock animation

Each component animates when triggered.

# 🔦 **2. Lights Turning On (Dial 1)**

When the user dials **1**:

* The room lights slowly brighten (from warm dim → soft glow)
* A subtle flicker effect plays, matching old bulbs warming up

* The lamp icon glows with a gentle pulse

---

# ☕ **3. Coffee Machine Activation (Dial 2)**

When dial **2** is selected:

* The coffee machine in the UI glows or lights up
* Steam animation begins rising

Optional spooky touch:

  **“Door Locked.”** or **“Door Unlocked.”**

---

# ❄️ **6. AC / Heater Mode (Dial 5)**

Dial **5** adjusts temperature control:

* Red glow → heating
* Frost or warmth particles animate for 1–2 seconds

Message:
**“Temperature set.”**

---

# 📞 **7. AI Assistant Activation (Dial 0)**

Dialing **0** makes the phone “wake up”:

* Receiver lifts or glows
* A white listening pulse appears around the phone
* The house UI darkens slightly (focus mode)

  **“Listening…”**
* AI voice responds through the UI speaker or typewriter animation

---

# 💬 **8. Status Feedback / Notifications**

Each action triggers:

* A small floating notification
* Soft sound feedback
* Highlight/border pulse around the affected device

Notifications appear in a small panel:

```
✓ Lights turned on  
✓ Coffee machine started  
✓ Weather reading…  
✓ Door locked  
```

---

# 🌫️ **Visual Atmosphere**

To match your spooky theme:

* Gentle fog overlays
* Warm candle-like glows
* Slightly vintage colors
* Occasional flicker in the room lights
* A shadow moving subtly when the phone “responds”

But keep it elegant, not horror.

# 🧙 **How Kiro Should Build It**

Break the home UI into components:

### Components

1. `<RotaryPhone />`
2. `<HomeLights />`
3. `<CoffeeMachine />`
4. `<SpeakerMusic />`
5. `<WeatherWindow />`
6. `<DoorLockUI />`
7. `<ThermostatControl />`
8. `<NotificationPanel />`

### State Example

```
dial = number
action = mappedFunction[dial]
homeState = { lights, coffee, music, door, temp }
```

Each component listens for updates and animates.
Animations: Framer Motion
Sounds: Howler.js
Styles: Tailwind CSS

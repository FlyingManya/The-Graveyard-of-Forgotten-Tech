Here is a **clear, complete, Kiro-friendly description** of the **Lava Lamp → Ambient Mood Assistant** invention.
This version focuses on **functionality**, **behavior**, **features**, and **what Kiro should build**, written like a *project specification* Kiro can directly act on.

# 🕯️ **Lava Lamp – Ambient Mood Assistant**

### *Specification & Functional Description (for Kiro to develop)*

The **Ambient Mood Assistant** is a modern reinterpretation of a classic **lava lamp**, redesigned to act as an intelligent, atmospheric device inside a room.
It keeps the familiar retro aesthetic—liquid blobs slowly drifting in a glass tube—but hidden inside are sensors, smart lighting systems, and a simple AI mood engine.

---

## 🎯 **Core Concept**

Rebuild a lava lamp as a **smart ambient device** that changes color, glow intensity, and motion patterns based on:

* the user’s mood
* ambient sound or music
* room light levels
* optional user input (button, app, or UI controls)

The lamp becomes a **calming, emotional indicator**—a decorative object that also reacts to the environment.

---

## 🧩 **Functional Requirements**

### 1. **Real-Time Mood Detection**

The lamp should change its color theme based on sensed mood inputs.
Inputs can be simulated for demo purposes. For example:

* “calm” → soft blues and purples
* “focused” → teal or white
* “stressed” → warm orange or red
* “happy” → bright yellows or multicolor drift

Mood input can come from:

* a mock API
* manual controls
* random generator
* text input from the user

Kiro should create the logic for interpreting mood → lamp color.

---

### 2. **Audio-Reactive Lighting**

The lamp should react to ambient sound or music:

* Glow pulses to the beat
* Color intensifies with volume
* Slow morphing for ambient soundscapes

Kiro should implement:

* audio input (real or simulated)
* basic amplitude detection
* visual response mapping

---

### 3. **Color & Glow Engine**

The lamp uses animated gradients or shape morphing to simulate lava-like movement.
Kiro should build:

* smooth transitions between color states
* a continuous “floating blob” animation (CSS, Canvas, or WebGL)
* ambient glow that extends onto the UI background

---

### 4. **Smart Home Integration (Optional Feature)**

If possible, add API endpoints or mock functions so the lamp can:

* turn on/off based on time
* shift color based on weather
* set modes (sleep, focus, relax, nightlight)

Kiro should structure the project so new triggers can be easily added.

---

### 5. **Interactive Web UI (to simulate the lamp)**

Kiro should create a UI component representing the lamp:

* A tall glass-like container
* Animated "lava blobs" inside
* Light bloom around the lamp
* Controls on the side:

  * Select mood
  * Toggle audio-reactive mode
  * Adjust brightness
  * Change color theme

This UI should feel like a modern digital twin of a lava lamp.

## 🧱 **Behavior Logic (Kiro Implementation Guide)**

### Color Mapping:

```
calm → #5A4FF0, #7A7AF5
happy → #FFD45E, #FF9B42
focused → #00D4C2, #15F5D1
stressed → #FF6C6C, #E63946
neutral → soft white, low glow
```

### Animation:

* Blob movement should be sinusoidal and slow (like real wax).
* Intensity increases during high emotional states.
* Drop shadows and outer glow change with brightness.

### Audio Mode:

* Peak detection → quick glow bursts
* Quiet moments → slow drifting colors

---

## 🧰 **Technical Requirements (for Kiro)**

### Frontend Stack:

* Next.js or React
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Framer Motion or GSAP for blob animation
* Howler.js or Web Audio API for sound analysis

### Components to Build:

* `<LampContainer />` — the glass lamp UI
* `<LavaBlob />` — animated organic shapes
* `<GlowLayer />` — outer glow and bloom
* `<MoodControls />` — buttons/sliders
* `<AudioVisualizer />` — sound-reactive engine

### Data Structures:

* moodState
* audioLevel
* colorPalette
* brightness
* animationSpeed

### Outputs:

* An interactive digital lava lamp
* Smooth mood transitions
* Responsive color and glow
* Optional smart triggers

## ✨ **Final Description for Kiro**

Build a **reactive ambient lava lamp component** that animates lava blobs inside a glowing glass container. The lamp changes its color theme and glow intensity based on mood, sound, or user-selected modes. Implement smooth transitions, soft lighting, and audio-reactive behavior. Include UI controls for mood selection, brightness, and animation speed. Use modern styling (Tailwind), animation libraries, and optional audio analysis to simulate a functioning smart lamp. The final result should feel immersive, atmospheric, and calming — a digital resurrection of the classic lava lamp with emotion-sensing features.
